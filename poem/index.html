'Twas brilling, and the slithy toves
<br>
    <span>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:</span>
<br>
All mimsy were the boregoves,
<br>
        <span>And the mome raths outgrabe.</span>
<br>
 <br>

<strong><em>"Beware the <b id= "Jabberwock"> Jabborwock, </b> my son!
<br>
    <span>The jews that bite, the claws that catch!</span>
<br>
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
<br>
    <span>The trumious Bandersnatch!"*</span> </em></strong>
<br>
 <br>

 He took his varpal sword in hand;
 <br>
    <span>Long time the manxome foe he sought-</span>
<br>
So rested he by the Tumtum tree
<br>
    <span>And stood awhile in thought.</span>
